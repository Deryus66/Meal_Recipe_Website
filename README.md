# Meal_Recipe_Website

Running Website can be viewed at: https://mealrecipesearch.herokuapp.com/

This website uses NodeJS in order to make axios calls to a meal recipe API. When the user searches for a food item, it will display the meal name, meal recipe, a YouTube link for how to make the meal, and the website the meal recipe comes from. Additionally, users can add reviews to the meal which will be stored in a database.
